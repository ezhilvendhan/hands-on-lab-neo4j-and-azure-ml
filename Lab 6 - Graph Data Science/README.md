# Lab 6 - Graph Data Science
In this lab, we're going to work with anoter notebook.  We're going to generate a graph embedding using Neo4j Graph Data Science (GDS).  This will be an additional feature we can use to train our machine learning model later.

## Create a Graph Embedding
So, let's get started!  As before, navigate to the notebook at `/Users/<YOUR_NAME>/notebooks/hands-on-lab-neo4j-and-azure-ml/Lab 6 - Graph Data Science/1_create_embedding.ipynb` fire up a kernel and run through it.

## AutoML on Embeddings
Now we're going to train a binary classifier on the full dataset, with the graph embeddings.  We'll use Azure Machine Learning AutoML.  Navigate to the notebook at `/Users/<YOUR_NAME>/notebooks/hands-on-lab-neo4j-and-azure-mlLab 6 - Graph Data Science/2_automl_embedding.ipynb`  Then run that.
