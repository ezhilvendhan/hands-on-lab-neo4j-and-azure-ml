# Lab 0 - Sign In
At the start of this lab you should have been handed credentials for AWS.  In this first section, we're going to use those to sign in.

## Improving the Labs
As you work through these labs, we'd really appreciate your feedback.  One way to help us improve is to open an issue by going [here](https://github.com/neo4j-partners/hands-on-lab-neo4j-and-sagemaker/issues).  Outright bugs, usability suggestions, and general comments are all appreciated.  Pull requests are great too!

## Sign into Azure
We're going to sign into a new Azure account.  You may already have other Azure accounts.  If you use Chrome, you might consider using incognito mode for these exercises.  That's not mandatory though and other browsers work fine too.
Our next step is to open the Azure portal [here](https://portal.azure.com/). 

Select "IAM User."

We're now authenticated and logged into the Azure console.

In the next lab we'll deploy Neo4j.
